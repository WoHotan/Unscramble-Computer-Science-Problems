Task0:
Use index to get the list element, so time complexity is O(1).

Task1:
This code use two for loops to traverse the list elements,
m for the tests list loop, n for the calls list loop, so the time is m+n.
Assuming m is close to n, so the time of the two loops is 2n,
and the time of the add function of the tuple is O(1), the time of the len() function also O(1),
total time is 2n + c.
So, Worst Case Big-O Notation is O(n).

Task2:
The first for loop with multiple x in y statements, 
x in y in worst case time is O(n), so worst case time is n*3n = 3n^2,
and the time complexity of the second for loop is n.
So, total time complexity is 3*n^2 + n + c, Worst Case Big-O Notation is O(n^2).

Task3:
This code contain two for loop and re match function and tuple add function,
So, the time complexity is 2n + k, Worst Case Big-O Notation is O(n).

Task4:
This code contain four for loop statements,and a sorted() function and other statements,
Assuming each for loop time complexity is n, the time complexity is 4n + nlogn + c,
Worst Case Big-O Notation is O(n).
